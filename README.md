# The Silhouette Project

## Brief Introduction
**Silhouette** is a compiler-based defense against code-reuse attacks on
embedded ARM systems that run a single bare-metal application.
It guarantees the integrity of all application return addresses and
also provides coarse-grained forward-edge control flow integrity.
